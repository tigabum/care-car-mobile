# Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a mobile application that facilitates on-demand car wash services. The app will connect customers who need car wash services with service providers (washers) who can perform these services at the customer's location. The app aims to provide a seamless booking experience, efficient service management, and secure payment processing.

# Implementation Logic

1. User Roles and Authentication:
   Roles: There are two main user roles: Customers and Washers.
   Authentication: Use Firebase Authentication to handle user registration and login. This will include email/password authentication and possibly social logins.
1. Booking System:
   Booking Creation: Customers can create bookings by selecting their location, vehicle type, and desired service package.
   Booking Management: Washers can view and manage bookings assigned to them, updating the status as they progress through the job.
1. Location Services:
   Maps Integration: Use Google Maps API to allow customers to select their location for the car wash service.
   Route Navigation: Provide washers with navigation to the customer's location.
1. Payment Processing:
   Payment Gateway: Integrate a payment gateway like Stripe to handle secure payments from customers.
   Invoice Generation: Generate invoices for completed services.
1. Rating and Reviews:
   Feedback System: Allow customers to rate and review the service they received, providing feedback to washers.
1. Real-time Updates:
   Booking Status: Use Firebase or another real-time database to update booking statuses in real-time for both customers and washers.
1. Push Notifications:
   Notifications: Implement push notifications to alert users about booking confirmations, status updates, and other important events.
   Implementation Steps
1. Frontend (React Native):
   Set up the project with React Native, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.
   Implement authentication screens and flows using Firebase.
   Create main screens for booking, profile management, and service browsing.
   Set up navigation using React Navigation.
   Integrate Google Maps for location selection.
1. Backend (Node.js + Express):
   Set up the server with Express and TypeScript.
   Implement RESTful API endpoints for user management, booking operations, and payment processing.
   Use MongoDB for data storage and management.
   Integrate Firebase Admin SDK for server-side authentication management.
1. State Management (Redux):
   Use Redux Toolkit to manage global state in the app.
   Create slices for handling authentication, bookings, and user data.
1. Testing and Deployment:
   Test the application thoroughly on both iOS and Android devices.
   Deploy the backend to a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
   Prepare the app for submission to the App Store and Google Play Store.
   This plan provides a comprehensive overview of the project's purpose and the steps needed to implement it. Let me know if you have any questions or if you're ready to proceed with a specific part of the implementation!
